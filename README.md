# bookmark-app

> A simple JavaScript bookmark manager built with Vue.js. You can add, edit, or delete any bookmarks form the list. To complete this project I have used Vue.js, Axios and Firebase, SCSS and a couple of external Vue libraries for UI purposes.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
